Introduction

Welcome to the Classical Music Listening Analysis project! This project explores the listening patterns of three popular classical composers: Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach. The aim of the project is to analysis the classic music trends as time pass and to know which composer is fading out and the one who is still trending.

Project Overview

Music is a soulful language that transcends time, and classical music, in particular, has been a cornerstone of cultural heritage for centuries. This project focuses on the analysis of a dataset containing information on how many times pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach were listened to on each day of the month. 

Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:
- Data Exploration: To load, clean, and understand the dataset.
- Visualization: To create visual representations of listening trends over the month.
- Statistical Analysis: To perform basic statistical analyses to summarize and compare listening patterns.
- Insights: To derive meaningful insights from the data regarding listening habits.
